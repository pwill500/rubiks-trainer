This is a Rubik's cube trainer that I created using Python and Pygame. It can help users solve a 2x2 rubik's cube with the beginner method or the 3x3 with the CFOP speedsolving method.

to do:
-------- overall --------
1. include sound to eliminate need to read the screen

2. include info for people with no background 
    - move notation
    - start with solving white
    - match case and then turn down to operate on front
    - first layer tips (inserting, L hand, R hand)
    - emphasize meaning of "x" and "f" as opposed to "F"
    - include tips in between steps ("yellow should be solved now")
    - greater detail about corner PLL cases (do you have 0 or 1 pair?)


-------- 3x3 stuff --------
1. outline white arrows in black for cw and ccw cases
