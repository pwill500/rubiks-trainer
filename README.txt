to do:
-------- overall --------
1. allow user to return to case selection from large cube graphic screen as opposed to going back to previous stage
2. include sound to eliminate need to read the screen


-------- 3x3 stuff --------
1. adjust line spacing for opposite and adjacent
    - the three separate lines on top, bottom, or side are touching in places, make sure that we have space between all

2. outline white arrows in black for cw and ccw cases

3. include info for people with no background 
    - move notation
    - start with solving white
    - match case and then turn down to operate on front
    - first layer tips (inserting, L hand, R hand)
    - emphasize meaning of "x" and "f" as opposed to "F"
    - include tips in between steps ("yellow should be solved now")
    - greater detail about corner PLL cases (do you have 0 or 1 pair?)
    

-------- 2x2 stuff --------
